                <header>What is Machine Learning?</header>
                <p>Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being
                    explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come
                    across.
                    As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The
                    ability
                    to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would
                    expect.</p>

                <header>Definition of Machine Learning</header>
                <p>Arthur Samuel, an early American leader in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence,
                    coined the term “Machine Learning ” in 1959 while at IBM. He defined machine learning as “the field
                    of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed “. However,
                    there is no universally accepted definition for machine learning. Different authors define the term
                    differently. We give below two more definitions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example data
                        or past experience . We have a model defined up to some parameters, and learning is the
                        execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data
                        or past experience. The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or
                        descriptive to gain knowledge from data.
                    </li>
                    <li>The field of study known as machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct
                        computer programs that automatically improve with experience.</li>

            <header>Applications Of Machine Learning</header>
            <p>Machine learning is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As is
                evident from the name, it gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to
                learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.
            </p>
            <p>Today, companies are using Machine Learning to improve business decisions, increase productivity, detect
                disease, forecast weather, and do many more things. With the exponential growth of technology, we not
                only need better tools to understand the data we currently have, but we also need to prepare ourselves
                for the data we will have. To achieve this goal we need to build intelligent machines. We can write a
                program to do simple things. But most of the time, Hardwiring Intelligence in it is difficult. The best
                way to do it is to have some way for machines to learn things themselves. A mechanism for learning – if
                a machine can learn from input then it does the hard work for us. This is where Machine Learning comes
                into action. Some of the most common examples are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Image Recognition</li>
                    <li>Speech Recognition</li>
                    <li>Recommender Systems</li>
                    <li>Fraud Detection</li>

                <header>Data and It's Processing</header>
                <p>Data Processing is the task of converting data from a given form to a much more usable and desired
                    form i.e. making it more meaningful and informative. Using Machine Learning algorithms, mathematical
                    modeling, and statistical knowledge, this entire process can be automated. The output of this
                    complete process can be in any desired form like graphs, videos, charts, tables, images, and many
                    more, depending on the task we are performing and the requirements of the machine. This might seem
                    to be simple but when it comes to massive organizations like Twitter, Facebook, Administrative
                    bodies like Parliament, UNESCO, and health sector organizations, this entire process needs to be
                    performed in a very structured manner. So, the steps to perform are as follows:</p>
                <p>Data processing is a crucial step in the machine learning (ML) pipeline, as it prepares the data for
                    use in building and training ML models. The goal of data processing is to clean, transform, and
                    prepare the data in a format that is suitable for modeling.</p>
                <p>There are many tools and libraries available for data processing in ML, including pandas for Python,
                    and the Data Transformation and Cleansing tool in RapidMiner. The choice of tools will depend on the
                    specific requirements of the project, including the size and complexity of the data and the desired
                    outcome.</p>
                <img src="images/data-processing.png" alt="data-processing">
                <header>Collection </header>
                <p>The most crucial step when starting with ML is to have data of good quality and accuracy. Data can be
                    collected from any authenticated source like data.gov.in, Kaggle or UCI dataset repository. For
                    example, while preparing for a competitive exam, students study from the best study material that
                    they can access so that they learn the best to obtain the best results. In the same way,
                    high-quality and accurate data will make the learning process of the model easier and better and at
                    the time of testing, the model would yield state-of-the-art results.
                    A huge amount of capital, time and resources are consumed in collecting data. Organizations or
                    researchers have to decide what kind of data they need to execute their tasks or research.
                    Example: Working on the Facial Expression Recognizer, needs numerous images having a variety of
                    human expressions. Good data ensures that the results of the model are valid and can be trusted
                    upon.</p>
                <code># Import libraries 
                        import numpy as np
                        import pandas as pd
                          
                        # Import dataset
                        df = pd.read_csv('../../data/Iris.csv')
                          
                        df['species'].unique()</code>
                <header>Preparation</header>
                <p>The collected data can be in a raw form which can’t be directly fed to the machine. So, this is a
                    process of collecting datasets from different sources, analyzing these datasets and then
                    constructing a new dataset for further processing and exploration. This preparation can be performed
                    either manually or from the automatic approach. Data can also be prepared in numeric forms also
                    which would fasten the model’s learning.
                    Example: An image can be converted to a matrix of N X N dimensions, the value of each cell will
                    indicate the image pixel.</p>
                <header>Input</header>
                <p>Now the prepared data can be in the form that may not be machine-readable, so to convert this data to
                    the readable form, some conversion algorithms are needed. For this task to be executed, high
                    computation and accuracy is needed. Example: Data can be collected through the sources like MNIST
                    Digit data(images), Twitter comments, audio files, video clips</p>
                <header>Output </header>
                <p>In this stage, results are procured by the machine in a meaningful manner which can be inferred
                    easily by the user. Output can be in the form of reports, graphs, videos, etc
                </p>
                <header>Storage</header>
                <p>This is the final step in which the obtained output and the data model data and all the useful
                    information are saved for future use.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="supervised_learning">
            <header>Supervised Learning</header>
            <p>Supervised learning is a machine learning technique that is widely used in various fields such as
                finance, healthcare, marketing, and more. It is a form of machine learning in which the algorithm is
                trained on labeled data to make predictions or decisions based on the data inputs.</p>

            <p>In supervised learning, the algorithm learns a mapping between the input and output data. This mapping
                is learned from a labeled dataset, which consists of pairs of input and output data. The algorithm tries
                to learn the relationship between the input and output data so that it can make accurate predictions on
                new, unseen data.</p>

            <p>The labeled dataset used in supervised learning consists of input features and corresponding output
                labels. The input features are the attributes or characteristics of the data that are used to make
                predictions, while the output labels are the desired outcomes or targets that the algorithm tries to
                predict.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="unsupervised_learning">
            <header>Unsupervised Learning</header>
            <p>Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor
                labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the
                machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without
                any prior training of data.</p>
            <p>Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine.
                Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by itself.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="reinforcement_learning">
            <header>Reinforcement Learning</header>
            <p>Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize
                reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best
                possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from
                supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so
                the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no
                answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a
                training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.</p>
            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behavior
                in an environment to obtain maximum reward. In RL, the data is accumulated from machine learning systems
                that use a trial-and-error method. Data is not part of the input that we would find in supervised or
                unsupervised machine learning.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="dimensionality_reduction">
            <header>Dimensionality Reduction</header>
            <p>Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features (or dimensions) in a dataset
                while retaining as much information as possible. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to
                reduce the complexity of a model, to improve the performance of a learning algorithm, or to make it
                easier to visualize the data. There are several techniques for dimensionality reduction, including
                principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), and linear discriminant analysis
                (LDA). Each technique uses a different method to project the data onto a lower-dimensional space while
                preserving important information.</p>
            <p>Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while
                retaining as much of the important information as possible. In other words, it is a process of
                transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space that still preserves the essence of
                the original data.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="natural_language_processing">
            <header>Natural Language Processing</header>
            <p>The essence of Natural Language Processing lies in making computers understand the natural language.
                That’s not an easy task though. Computers can understand the structured form of data like spreadsheets
                and the tables in the database, but human languages, texts, and voices form an unstructured category of
                data, and it gets difficult for the computer to understand it, and there arises the need for Natural
                Language Processing.</p>
            <p>There’s a lot of natural language data out there in various forms and it would get very easy if computers
                can understand and process that data. We can train the models in accordance with expected output in
                different ways. Humans have been writing for thousands of years, there are a lot of literature pieces
                available, and it would be great if we make computers understand that. But the task is never going to be
                easy. There are various challenges floating out there like understanding the correct meaning of the
                sentence, correct Named-Entity Recognition(NER), correct prediction of various parts of speech,
                coreference resolution(the most challenging thing in my opinion).</p>
            <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence that
                deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. The primary goal of NLP is to enable
                computers to understand, interpret, and generate natural language, the way humans do.</p>
            <p>NLP involves a variety of techniques, including computational linguistics, machine learning, and
                statistical modeling. These techniques are used to analyze, understand, and manipulate human language

            <p>ANN learning is robust to errors in the training data and has been successfully applied for learning
                real-valued, discrete-valued, and vector-valued functions containing problems such as interpreting
                visual scenes, speech recognition, and learning robot control strategies. The study of artificial neural
                networks (ANNs) has been inspired in part by the observation that biological learning systems are built
                of very complex webs of interconnected neurons in brains.</p>
            <p>The human brain contains a densely interconnected network of approximately 10^11-10^12 neurons, each
                connected neuron, on average connected, to l0^4-10^5 other neurons. So on average human brain takes
                approximately 10^-1 to make surprisingly complex decisions. ANN systems are motivated to capture this
                kind of highly parallel computation based on distributed representations.</p>
            <p>Generally, ANNs are built out of a densely interconnected set of simple units, where each unit takes a
                number of real-valued inputs and produces a single real-valued output. But ANNs are less motivated by
                biological neural systems, there are many complexities to biological neural systems that are not modeled
                by ANNs.</p>

            <p><Strong>Flask script:</Strong> Before starting with the coding part, we need to download flask and some
                other libraries. Here, we make use of a virtual environment, where all the libraries are managed which
                makes both the development and deployment job easier. </p>
            <p>Here is the code to run the code using a virtual environment.</p>
            <code>mkdir income-prediction
                    cd income-prediction
                    python3 -m venv venv</code>
            <code>source venv/bin/activate</code>
            <p>Now let’s install Flask. </p>
            <code>pip install flask</code>
            <p>Let’s create folder templates. In your application, you will use templates to render HTML which will
                display in the user’s browser. This folder contains our HTML form file index.html.</p>
            <code>mkdir templates</code>
            <p>Create script.py file in the project folder and copy the following code.
                Here we import the libraries, then using app=Flask(__name__) we create an instance of flask.
                @app.route(‘/’) is used to tell flask what URL should trigger the function index() and in the function
                index, we use render_template(‘index.html’) to display the script index.html in the browser.</p>
            <p>Let’s run the application.</p>
            <code>export FLASK_APP=script.py   #this line will work in linux
                            set FLASK_APP=script.py      # this it the code  for windows.
                            run flask</code>
            <p>This should run the application and launch a simple server. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the html
                form.</p>
