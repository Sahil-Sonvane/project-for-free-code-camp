                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, on 28 December 1937. He is the
                    son of Naval Tata, who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata family, and Sooni Tata, the
                    niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, was a
                    member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents separated, and he was
                    subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of Ratanji Tata. He
                    has a younger brother Jimmy Tata and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second marriage
                    with Simone Tata, with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati.
                    He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class. After which, he studied at the
                    Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and the Riverdale
                    Country School in New York City, which he graduated from in 1955. After graduating from
                    high school, Tata enrolled in Cornell University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree
                    in architecture in 1959. In 1975, he attended the seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard
                    Business School, an institution which he has since endowed.</p>

                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by
                    turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around. In 1991, J. R. Tata stepped
                    down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor.</p>
                <p>During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit over 50 times.
                    He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus.
                    These acquisitions repositioned Tata from an India-centric group into a global business.
                </p>
                <p>Ratan Tata resigned his executive powers in the Tata group on 28 December 2012. An ensuing leadership
                    crisis over his succession drew intense media scrutiny. Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the
                    chairman of Tata Sons in January 2017. In February 2017, Cyrus Mistry was removed as a director for
                    Tata Sons.</p>
